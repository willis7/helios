## Git & Version Control

- Add and commit automatically whenever an entire task is finished
- Use descriptive commit messages that capture the full scope of changes

## Retrieving library documentation by using Context 7

When the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation, use the context7 mcp server to get the information.

## Verifying features in the browser

Use the Playwright MCP server to verify features in the browser.
Check for console errors and ensure the implemented functionality is working as expected.

## **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:** Code Quality Checks

**ALWAYS follow these instructions before completing a task.**

Automatically use the IDE's built-in diagnostics tool to check for linting and type errors:
   - Run `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` to check all files for diagnostics
   - Fix any linting or type errors before considering the task complete
   - Do this for *each* file you create or edit

This is a CRITICAL step that must NEVER be skipped when working on any code-related task.
